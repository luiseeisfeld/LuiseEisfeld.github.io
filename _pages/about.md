I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at [HEC Lausanne](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnUnite.php?UnId=23&LanCode=37&menu=equi) (the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Lausanne) and Faculty Member of the [Swiss Finance Institute](https://www.sfi.ch/en/faculty). I am also an affiliated member of the [AI & Digital Finance Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/rmihet/ai-finance-lab) at HEC Lausanne.

**Research interests:**
* Primary: Corporate Finance; Industrial Organization
* Secondary: Economics of Digitization & Innovation; Competition Policy

In my research, I study competition, M&As, and innovation in the context of digitization. More broadly, I am interested in the implications of digitization for market outcomes and economic welfare. 

I am an empirical researcher, and I use both reduced-form analysis and structural econometric models of firm and consumer behavior. My most recent [papers](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/research/) study entry and market dynamics in software industries, and the functioning of online marketplaces. Both papers use novel datasets.

My research and my teaching at the University of Lausanne have been rewarded with multiple awards in recent years. I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu) in 2023. In 2022, I spent six months at the [Technology and Policy Research Initiative](https://sites.bu.edu/tpri/) at Boston University.
