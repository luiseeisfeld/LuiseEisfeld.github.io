## [Entry and Acquisitions in Software Markets](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/assets/docs/Eisfeld_EntryAcq.pdf) (October 2025)

How do acquisitions of young, innovative, venture capital-funded firms (startups) affect firms’ incentives to enter a market? I build a novel product-level dataset of enterprise software, and apply text-as-data methods to identify competing firms. I document new empirical patterns on startup acquisitions in software, including who acquires whom, and how these acquisitions relate to subsequent
entry. To interpret these patterns and to quantify the underlying mechanisms, I build and estimate a dynamic model of startup entry in the face of these acquisitions. In the model, acquisitions influence returns to entry (1) by affecting market structure, and (2) by creating an entry-for-buyout incentive for potential entrants. Using the estimated model, I simulate how entry would evolve under alternative merger policies. The simulations reveal that, if all startup acquisitions were blocked, entry would decline by about 16% in the average market. By contrast, blocking acquisitions conducted by established incumbents at high transaction prices increases entry slightly. Accordingly, enforcement that prioritizes review of incumbent-led, high-value acquisitions is likely to sustain startup entry.

## [How do Online Product Rankings Influence Sellers’ Pricing Behavior?](https://luiseeisfeld.github.io/assets/docs/HotelRankings_Eisfeld_TSE.pdf)

Products that are displayed more prominently on e-commerce platforms are more likely to be found and purchased by consumers. The algorithms ranking these products, however, may condition a product's position in a listings page on its price. Using web-scraped data from hotels displayed on Expedia and an instrumental variable identification strategy, I find that the ranking algorithm tends to display hotels at _less_ favorable positions at times at which they are priced _higher_. I provide a framework that employs these estimates jointly with demand parameters obtained from a sequential search model. I simulate a counterfactual scenario, and reveal that Expedia's ranking algorithm tends to intensify price competition between sellers compared to a random ranking. This increases consumer welfare, but reduces seller profits. My finding has consequences for two-sided platforms' optimal design of ranking algorithms: in order to foster adoption, platforms should carefully trade off benefits arising to the two sides, and consider equilibrium effects.
